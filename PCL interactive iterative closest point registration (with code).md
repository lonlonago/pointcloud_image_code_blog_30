#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

>  It is the ICP algorithm, which adds some sao operations to the code to control the number of iterations and display of the algorithm with the mouse and keyboard. How to operate it has been explained in detail in the code. For the specific theory of the algorithm, please refer to: PCL ICP algorithm realizes point cloud fine registration
