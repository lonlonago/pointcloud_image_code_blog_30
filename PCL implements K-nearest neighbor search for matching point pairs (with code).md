##  First, the algorithm basis 

   According to the algorithm principle of KDTree, when the number k of neighborhood points is 1, a one-to-one mapping relationship is established between the search points and the neighborhood points. At this time, the searched neighborhood point is the point with the smallest distance from the search point and the neighborhood point.
