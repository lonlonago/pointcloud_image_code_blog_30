#  Introduction to use 

   Knowing the index of a point, to extract the point from the original point cloud data, an index extractor is required to achieve it, and the application range of the index extractor is very wide. 

##  1. Main function 

  ```python

  ```  
>  Provides a pointer to the index vector representing the input data. Note: The index here, the structure of indices is a simple vector of type int. 

##  2. Define the index
